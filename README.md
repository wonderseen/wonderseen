### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an NLP algorithm engineer graduated from Xiamen University with bachelor degree (2015-2019) and Tianjin University with master degree (2019-2022).

My research interests include: 

- ðŸ”­ clustering analysis (fuzzy clustering theory and linguistic clustering)
- ðŸŒ± machine translation (text-only and multimodal machine translation)
- ðŸ‘¯ multimodal learning (pretraining technology and reasoning)

I am passionate about specializing in algorithms and fit them into practical applications.
